### Our product

Elsy Medical develops E-biopsy – a minimally invasive molecular sampling tool for solid tissue diagnostics!

### <a href="https://youtu.be/mmqsOUK2Qko" > What is E-biopsy??

A minimally invasive molecular sampling tool for solid tissues in vivo with electroporation for rapid diagnostics

E-biopsy - is a minimally invasive molecular sampling method that utilizes in-situ electroporation (i.e., pulsed electric fields) to disrupt cell membranes in a targeted area, resulting in the release of cellular components, such as proteins and lipids. Tissue extract is then collected using a syringe, and subsequently, the content is discharged to an external buffer and undergoes molecular analysis consisting of purification, separation, identification, and quantification of the molecular structure of the tissue extract removed. 

The electroporation system consists of a pulsed electric field generator, an applicator, and an analysis unit providing information on the extracted cellular contents.

The feasibility of the E-biopsy was already demonstrated by the project team in animal and in ex vivo human clinical studies. The technology is not limited to a specific tissue, and as such, may support a broad range of clinical applications, such as screening, aiding in diagnosis, detecting of recurrence of tumor post-intervention, assessing tumor heterogeneity, and more. Being an alternative to many other lesion-analysis approaches, it may also augment them leading to improved analysis quality.

Due to its minimally invasive nature, the E-biopsy enables the gathering of multiple samples from the same lesion, opening the possibility of creating its high-resolution spatial molecular profile,  and increasing the sensitivity and specificity of the analysis. Being both simple and molecular-based sampling technology, the E-biopsy approach reduces the load on many clinical resources, and especially on pathologists, thus improving the medical treatment efficiency and reducing the overall costs.

### Value proposition

The ability to rapidly discern normal from cancerous tissue while still at the doctor’s office would be a tremendous benefit to the field of dermatology, pathology, and to medicine in general. With patented technology, Elsy Medical has built a revolutionary electroporation device that is pain free, to "liquify" minute amounts of questionable tissue and using deep tech/AI to analyze the mixture against biomarkers and provide an extremely accurate result for the clinician and patient. A world's first minimally invasive rapid diagnostic for skin and other tissue diseases.

### The need/problem

Currently only extremely experienced and specifically trained dermatologists and endoscopists can accurately identify Basal and Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Barrett's esophagus lesions without using the histopathology. Our revolutionary tool would enable less highly trained physicians and non-specialists to accurately and rapidly identify margins as well as tissue type of various cancerous lesions.   

### Market size

There are 15M diagnostic procedures for non-melanoma skin cancer in the USA annually. There are 5,333 Dermatology businesses in the USA as of Jan 2023 not including hospitals. This also does not include the other physicians like internists who would also use this tool to screen patients. 
Barrett's esophagus condition affects 5.6% of the US population, the ACG guidelines require surveillance diagnostics every 4 years with monitoring of these patients for the remainder of their lives.  There are 2,216 endoscopy centers in the USA as of 2022 not including hospitals.









### Challenge

Current tissue diagnostics often  involves tissue biopsy which is time-consuming, costly, has immediate and long term complications such as pain and scars, carries significant environmental impacts, costs time of surgery room, time of a physician, nurse, other personal and is required in the some countries by insurance companies before any surgery.  

### Elsy solution 

We developed a novel approach for minimally invasive, in vivo  tissue sampling with molecular biopsy using electric fields.
