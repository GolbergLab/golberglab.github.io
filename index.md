Elsy envisions a world where every patient will get molecular profiling of suspicious lesion on a spot

We provide on the spot molecular profiling of solid tissues using  our novel, IP protected, minimally invasive in-vivo molecular sampling with electric fields. 

### Challenge

Current tissue diagnostics often  involves tissue biopsy which is time-consuming, costly, has immediate and long term complications such as pain and scars, carries significant environmental impacts, costs time of surgery room, time of a physician, nurse, other personal and is required in the some countries by insurance companies before any surgery.  

### Elsy solution 

We developed a novel approach for minimally invasive, in vivo  tissue sampling with molecular biopsy using electric fields.
